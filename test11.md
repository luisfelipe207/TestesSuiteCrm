# Test Case 11: Data Query Performance

## 1. Introduction and Description
This activity aims to provide a realistic software testing experience within the SuiteCRM environment, combining code analysis with hands-on testing. The focus is on producing detailed and well-organized test reports that simulate the daily tasks of a software tester. The tested software is SuiteCRM, accessed at [https://crm.alunostds.dev.br](https://crm.alunostds.dev.br).

## 2. Test Title
**Data Query Performance**

## 3. Description
This test evaluates the response time of SuiteCRM when performing queries on large datasets, checking if it stays within acceptable limits for user experience.

## 4. Objective
To measure and assess the system's performance when executing data queries, ensuring that the response times are within acceptable thresholds even under higher data loads.

## 5. What is Being Tested
The backend performance and response times during data retrieval operations in SuiteCRM.

## 6. Prerequisites
- Valid Admin or Standard User credentials:
  - Admin Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin123`
- Access to the SuiteCRM instance at [https://crm.alunostds.dev.br](https://crm.alunostds.dev.br)
- Supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, or Edge)
- Internet connection
- Stopwatch or browser inspection tools to measure response times

## 7. Test Procedure
1. Log in to SuiteCRM as Admin.
2. Access the Contacts, Accounts, or Leads module.
3. Perform multiple search queries and navigate between large lists of records.
4. Measure the time it takes for the page to load after each query.

## 8. Expected Result
The system should return search results within an acceptable time frame (preferably under 5 seconds for standard operations).

## 9. Actual Result
The web application responded normally during searches. Although slightly slower due to server limitations, the overall performance remained acceptable and within a usable range for a CRM system.

## 10. Result Analysis
‚úÖ **Test Passed** ‚Äî Despite minor slowness attributed to the server performance, the system handled data queries adequately without impacting the user experience critically.

## 11. Error Description (if applicable)
- **Minor Observation**: Server response was slightly delayed in heavier queries, but no critical performance degradation occurred.
